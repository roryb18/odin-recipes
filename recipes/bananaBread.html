<h3>Description</h2>
    <p>Banana bread is a type of sweet bread made from mashed bananas. It is often a moist and sweet quick bread but some recipes are yeast raised.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
        <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
        <li>Butter: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
        <li>Brown sugar: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
        <li>Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat the butter and sugar in another bowl. Add the eggs and mashed bananas.</li>
        <li>Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into a loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven.</li>
    </ol>
